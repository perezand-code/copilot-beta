/**
 * This class finds the maximum flow in a directed graph as follows. First a copy
 * of the graph is made and will be used as a 'residual' graph. Then we have a recursive
 * method 'runMaxFlow' that performs the following steps:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Find the shortest path from the source to the destination in the residual graph.</li>
 *     <li>If no path is found, return the current maximum flow.</li>
 *     <li>Find the minimum weight of the edges in the path; this is the bottleneck. It is
 *     added to the current maximum flow</li>
 *     <li>Modify the residual graph by subtracting the bottleneck from the edges in the path
 *     (removing the edges if the weight becomes zero) and adding the bottleneck to the reverse edges.</li>
 *     <li>Repeat the process until no more paths can be found.</li>
 * </ul>
