/**
 * This class implements the Kosaraju algorithm for finding strongly connected components.
 * A strongly connected component (SCC) is a maximal subgraph where every vertex is reachable
 * from every other vertex in the subgraph. The algorithm works is two passes:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Perform topological sort on the original graph starting from every vertex.
 * This will give a topological ordering of the vertices.
 * <li> Reverse the graph, clear the visited set, and perform a DFS on the
 * vertices in the order given by the topological sort. Each time a new vertex
 * is visited, a new strongly connected component is started.
 * </ul>
