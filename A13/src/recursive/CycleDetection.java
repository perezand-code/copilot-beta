/**
 * This is a re-implementation of the cycle detection algorithm but using a recursive
 * approach. The algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS) strategy to traverse the
 * graph and detect cycles. It maintains a stack of vertices that are currently being
 * visited. If a vertex is revisited while it is still in the stack, a cycle is detected.
 * You only need to override one of more of the abstract methods of the DFS class.
